    // simplifies a few things for this demo app. It is better to have a data
    // store at the top level of your app, such as in your App Delegate, and
    // then pass it down to objectst that need it. Passing the data store around
    // makes it much easier to test your classes by passing them a mock data
    // store, or a data store that does not save changes to disk.
